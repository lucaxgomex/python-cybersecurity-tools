# Basic Python Tools for Cybersecurity

The Python programming language is well-known for its automation operations, libraries, machine learning applications and community support.

According [Softteco](https://softteco.com/blog/python-for-cybersecurity), the language can run on various operating systems such as Windows, Linunx (where is bult-in) and macOS without previous code modifications or dependencies instalations. Bedides, it can integrate with technologies and tools used in cybersecurity, making it much more adaptable to any environment.

This projects has been desined to simulate the following tools:

### Firewall

### DoS Blocker

### Ping Sweeper

### Port Scanner

### Service Fingerprinting

### OS Fingerprinting

### Wrapper

## 🎛️ Script

To execute this project, you need to use the `scapy` library for the Python language. This tool allows you to interact with packets on computer networks, which is very useful when dealing with pentesting practices. 

Each tool is segmented into a different directory, which ensures organization based on their respective functionalities. In each of these directories, there is a `script.sh` file, which ensures the creation of a virtual environment within which the aforementioned library is installed. This action eliminates the need to install any tools locally, in case the project needs to grow with the implementation of additional features.

To create the virtual environment, access one of the directories with a tool that has caught your attention and execute the following command:

```bash
source script.sh
```
