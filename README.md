## Basic Python Script for Cybersecurity

The Python programming language is well-known for its automation operations, libraries, machine learning applications and community support.

According [Softteco](https://softteco.com/blog/python-for-cybersecurity), the language can run on various operating systems such as Windows, Linunx (where is bult-in) and macOS without previous code modifications or dependencies instalations. Bedides, it can integrate with technologies and tools used in cybersecurity, making it much more adaptable to any environment.

This projects has been desined to simulate the following tools:
